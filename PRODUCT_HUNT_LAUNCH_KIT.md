## **‚ùì FAQ RESPONSES (Pre-written)**

### **Common Questions & Answers**

**Q: How is this different from existing summarization tools?**
A: Most tools require you to copy/paste content manually. SummaryAI integrates directly with Slack and automatically identifies conversations worth summarizing. Plus, we focus specifically on extracting decisions and action items, not just general summaries.

**Q: What about privacy and security?**
A: We take security seriously. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We only access conversations you explicitly choose to summarize, and we never store your Slack data permanently. SOC 2 compliance coming soon.

**Q: Does it work with other platforms besides Slack?**
A: Slack is our primary focus right now, but we're planning Teams, Discord, and email integration based on user feedback. What platform would you most like to see next?

**Q: How accurate are the summaries?**
A: Our AI achieves 95%+ accuracy on key information extraction. Each summary includes a confidence score so you know how reliable it is. Users can also provide feedback to improve accuracy over time.

**Q: What's your pricing model?**
A: We offer a generous free tier (10 summaries/month) so you can try it risk-free. Pro plan is $29/month for 500 summaries + advanced features. Enterprise is $99/month for unlimited usage + team management.

**Q: Can I customize the summary format?**
A: Yes! You can choose from different styles (bullet points, paragraphs, action-focused) and adjust the tone (formal, casual, technical). Custom templates coming soon.

**Q: How do you handle long conversations?**
A: Our AI can process conversations of any length. For very long threads, we use intelligent chunking to maintain context while extracting the most important information.

**Q: Is there an API?**
A: API access is available for Enterprise customers. We're also planning a public API based on demand. Let us know if this is important for your use case!
