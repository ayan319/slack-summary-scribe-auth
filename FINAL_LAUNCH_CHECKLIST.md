  - Look for "Auto-created workspace" messages
  - No error messages should appear

## üö® Critical Success Criteria

### Must Have Zero Issues:
- [ ] **No "no organization found" errors**
- [ ] **All new users get workspaces automatically**
- [ ] **All existing users have workspaces**
- [ ] **Dashboard loads without onboarding redirect**
- [ ] **Health score is 100%**

### Performance Checks:
- [ ] **Signup completes in < 3 seconds**
- [ ] **Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds**
- [ ] **No database timeout errors**
- [ ] **Trigger executes within 1 second**

## üìä Production Monitoring Setup

### 1. Daily Health Checks
```bash
# Add to cron job (runs daily at 9 AM)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/project && node scripts/audit-workspace-health.js
```

### 2. Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Run continuous monitoring (every 5 minutes)
node scripts/audit-workspace-health.js --monitor
```

### 3. Health Check Endpoint
- Monitor: `/api/health/workspaces`
- Set up alerts if status != "healthy"
- Alert if health score < 95%

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### If Users Don't Get Workspaces:
1. Check trigger exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers 
   WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
   ```

2. Recreate trigger if missing:
   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
     AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
     FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user_signup();
   ```

3. Run audit function:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM public.audit_and_fix_users_without_orgs();
   ```

### If Health Score < 100%:
1. Run audit script: `node scripts/audit-workspace-health.js`
2. Check for users without orgs
3. Fix automatically with audit function
4. Verify trigger is working

### If Dashboard Shows Onboarding:
1. Check user has organization in database
2. Verify AuthProvider is working correctly
3. Check getUserOrganizations function
4. Run audit to fix user
