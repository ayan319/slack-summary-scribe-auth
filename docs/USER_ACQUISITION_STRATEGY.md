## Cold Outreach Strategy

### Email Templates

#### Template 1: Founder Outreach
```
Subject: Save 10+ hours weekly on meeting notes (2-min read)

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] recently raised [funding round] - congrats! üéâ

As you scale, I imagine you're spending more time in investor meetings, team standups, and customer calls. The manual note-taking probably eats up 10+ hours of your week.

I built SummaryAI to solve exactly this problem. It's an AI that:
- Turns any conversation into clear summaries in 30 seconds
- Extracts action items and decisions automatically  
- Integrates with Slack, Notion, and your existing tools

500+ founders are already using it to save time and never miss important details.

Would you be interested in a 5-minute demo? I can show you how [Similar Company] saves 15 hours weekly.

Best,
[Your name]

#### Template 2: Sales Team Outreach
```
Subject: How [Similar Company] increased close rate by 30%

Hi [Name],

I saw your post about [specific sales challenge] on LinkedIn. This resonates because I've seen many sales teams struggle with the same issue.

[Similar Company]'s sales team was missing buying signals and spending hours on call notes. After implementing SummaryAI, they:

‚úÖ Increased close rate by 30%
‚úÖ Saved 8+ hours weekly per rep
‚úÖ Never missed a follow-up again

The AI captures every detail from sales calls and identifies opportunities automatically.

Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see how this could work for [Company]? I can share the exact results [Similar Company] achieved.

Best,
[Your name]

üìö Convert lectures into comprehensive study materials
‚ôø Improve accessibility for all students
‚è∞ Save 5+ hours weekly on documentation
üìù Generate automatic study guides

The AI creates detailed notes from any lecture or meeting, helping students learn better while saving you time.
